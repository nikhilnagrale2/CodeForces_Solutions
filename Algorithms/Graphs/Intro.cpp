/*
Graph is a data structure having two component
vertex / node
edge - the edge connects two nodes

graph - whenever you have a set of nodes and they are connected by an edge it is graph

Two types of graph
Undirected and Directed Graph
Undirected - A graph not having direction
Directed - A graph having direction

Indegree - Incoming edges to a node
OutDegree - Outgoing edges from a node

In Undirected graph
total degree = 2 * Edges

Path - sequence of nodes or vertex such that none of the nodes are repeating or visited twice in that path.

Two types of graph
Cyclic Graph 
Acyclic Graph

Directed Acyclic Graph
Undirected Acyclic Graph

Two types of graphs
weighted graphs
unweighted graphs
